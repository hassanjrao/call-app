            Getting a virtual number for WhatsApp involves a similar process to acquiring one for Telegram. Here's a general
            outline of how you might obtain a virtual number for WhatsApp:
        </h5>
        <ul>
            <p>Choose a Virtual Number Provider:</p>
            <li>

                Select a reputable virtual number provider that offers virtual numbers suitable for WhatsApp. Some popular
                providers include Twilio, Google Voice, Burner, and TextNow.
            </li>
            <p>Sign Up for an Account:</p>
            <li>

                Visit the website of your chosen virtual number provider and create an account. You may need to provide
                personal information and payment details during the signup process.
            </li>
            <p>Select a Phone Number:</p>
            <li>

                Once you've signed up and logged into your account, you can browse available virtual phone numbers. Look for
                numbers that support WhatsApp verification. Choose a number that fits your needs and preferences.
            </li>
            <p>Verify Your Number on WhatsApp:</p>
            <li>

                After selecting a virtual phone number, open the WhatsApp app and start the registration process. Enter the
                virtual phone number when prompted, and then wait for the verification code to be sent via SMS or voice
                call.
            </li>
            <p>Enter Verification Code:</p>
            <li>

                Once you receive the verification code, enter it into the WhatsApp app to verify your virtual phone number.
                Once verified, you can complete the registration process and start using WhatsApp with your virtual number.
            </li>
            <p>Keep Your Virtual Number Active:</p>
            <li>

                Maintain your virtual number by ensuring it remains active and funded according to the policies of your
                chosen provider. Some providers may require ongoing payment or activity to keep the number active.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="instruction-end">Remember to comply with all terms of service and legal requirements when using virtual
            phone numbers for WhatsApp or any other service. Additionally, keep in mind that the availability and specific
            steps for obtaining a virtual number for WhatsApp may vary depending on your location and the policies of the
            virtual number provider.</p>
