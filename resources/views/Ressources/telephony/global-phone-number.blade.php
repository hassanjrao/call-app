            </li><p>Select the Countries or Regions:</p>
            <li>
                
                Once you've created an account, you can select the countries or regions from which you want to obtain phone numbers. Most providers offer a wide range of options covering multiple continents.
            </li><p>Choose the Types of Numbers:</p>
            <li>
                
                Providers typically offer different types of numbers, such as local, toll-free, mobile, and vanity numbers. Choose the types that best suit your needs and preferences.
            </li><p>Verify Your Identity:</p>
            <li>
                
                Some providers may require you to verify your identity before purchasing phone numbers, especially for certain countries or regions where regulations are strict.
            </li><p>Purchase Phone Numbers:</p>
            <li>
                
                After selecting the countries, regions, and types of numbers you need, proceed to purchase them through the provider's platform. Make sure to review the pricing and any associated fees for each number.
            </li><p>Configure Numbers:</p>

            </li><p>Test and Monitor:</p>
            <li>
                
                Before using the global phone numbers in production, perform testing to ensure that they are working as expected. Monitor call quality and reliability over time to identify any issues and address them promptly.
            </li><p>Maintain and Renew:</p>
            <li>
