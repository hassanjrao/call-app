            What is a Hosted Contact Center? Benefits and Key Differences
        </h5>
        <p>
            A hosted contact center, also known as a cloud contact center, is a customer service solution where the contact center infrastructure and software are hosted and managed by a third-party provider in the cloud. Unlike traditional on-premises contact centers, which require significant hardware and software investments, hosted contact centers offer a scalable and flexible solution that can adapt to the changing needs of businesses.
